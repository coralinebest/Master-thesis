### Overview

This master thesis investigates the complexities of career trajectories within the French labor market and evaluates the effects of potential unemployment policy changes on the disposable income of various household types. 

### Key Components
- **Sequence Analysis**: The study applies sequence analysis on a comprehensive dataset of longitudinal job records to identify and classify distinct career paths. Multiple dissimilarity criteria were used, resulting in the identification of seven unique clusters, each representing a different combination of employment, unemployment, and education-related statuses.
  
- **Cluster Insights**: The research reveals significant disparities in career trajectories, particularly in the distribution of employment status between men and women.

- **Dynamic Model**: A dynamic model was developed to assess the impacts of unemployment reforms, simulating social benefits for hypothetical households both before and after policy changes. The analysis shows an average reduction of 92.4 euros in disposable income post-reform, with social benefits (RSA, AL) helping to mitigate the financial impact.
